XGBoost's ability to handle such complexities through its ensemble learning approach makes it a great fit for this domain.\n4. **Interpretability**: While not explicitly mentioned, XGBoost provides feature importance scores, which can be useful in understanding the relationships between predictor variables and the target variable.\n\nWhile Random Forest also performed well, its CV score (0.997) is slightly lower than XGBoost's. Logistic Regression, on the other hand, has a relatively lower CV score of 0.849, making it less suitable for this task.\n\nTherefore, based on these results, I would recommend using XGBoost as the best model for the healthcare domain in this context."
