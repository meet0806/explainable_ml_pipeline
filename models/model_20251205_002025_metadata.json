        "llm_recommendation": "Based on the provided model results, I would recommend using the **Random Forest** model for the finance domain and here's why:\n\n1. **Higher cross-validation score**: Random Forest has a higher cross-validation score (0.901230450348066) compared to XGBoost (0.8939956536349503) and SVM (0.9006137563787892).\n2. **Robustness in finance domain**: Finance is a high-stakes domain where even small errors can have significant consequences. Random Forest's higher score suggests that it may be more robust and less prone to overfitting, which is essential for reliable predictions.\n3. **Interpretability**: Random Forest provides feature importances, making it easier to understand which variables are driving the predictions. This interpretability is crucial in finance where decision-makers need to explain their models' outputs.\n\nThat being said, XGBoost and SVM are both strong algorithms, and depending on the specific problem requirements, one of them might be more suitable. However, based on the provided results, Random Forest appears to be the best choice for this particular task.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n* For finance tasks, it's essential to consider other aspects such as model explainability, fairness, and robustness.\n* You may want to evaluate other hyperparameters or tuning strategies to further improve the performance of each model.\n* If you have a larger dataset, you might need to consider more computationally expensive models like gradient boosting.\n\n**Example code:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'model_results' is a list of dictionaries containing model results\nbest_model = max(model_results, key=lambda x: x['cv_score'])\nprint(f\"Best model: {best_model['algorithm']} with CV score: {best_model['cv_score']}\")\n```\nThis code selects the best model based on its cross-validation score. You can modify it to suit your specific requirements and task type."
